# Stability Of Strange Dwarfs

This is the code I wrote for my bachelor thesis in the Physics Department of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, "Stability of Strange Dwarfs" | Supervisor: Ch. C. Moustakidis. This project was the first time I used Python and learnt Computational Physics, so the code is efficientwise speaking, not the most optimal, .  
The whole thesis can be accessed for free using AUTh's website, [here](https://ikee.lib.auth.gr/record/360475/?ln=en). 

The whole goal of the thesis was to calculate the fundamental eigenvalue of the Sturm-Liouville Stability Problem of Strange Dwarf star configurations, in order to determine their stability. The papers of Glendenning (1995) and Alford (2017) were the base models of this study.
